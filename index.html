<h1>Hi I'm Jesse Kauppi</h1>
<p>My name is Jesse and I enjoy sleeping and stuff.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Oh, where do I even begin? I'm the poster child for laziness and unproductivity. If there were a gold medal for procrastination, I'd be the undisputed champion. My love affair with my cozy bed knows no bounds, and I've perfected the art of hitting the snooze button with precision.

    You see, while others are burning the midnight oil, I'm probably dreaming about a world where naps are a legitimate form of currency. Productivity? That's just a foreign concept to me. I'd rather binge-watch Netflix series until my eyes glaze over than tackle my assignments.
    
    My room is a chaotic mess, resembling a war zone of unwashed dishes, unfolded laundry, and scattered textbooks. And studying? Well, it's a skill I've yet to master. I can turn the simplest task into an Olympic event of procrastination, spending hours scrolling through social media or daydreaming about my next nap.</p>
